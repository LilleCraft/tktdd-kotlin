## Designing score type

Now you have two distinct types, PointsData and FortyData, that keep track of the score at two different phases of a tennis game. You still need to model the remaining three phases, and somehow turn all of these into a single type. This is an undertaking that can be surprisingly complicated in C# or Java, but is trivial to do with a variant:

```Kotlin
sealed class Score{
    data class Points(val pointsData : PointsData) : Score()
    data class Forty(val fortyData : FortyData) : Score()
    object Deuce : Score()
    data class Advantage(val player : Player) : Score()
    data class Game(val player : Player) : Score()
}

typealias Points = Score.Points
typealias Forty = Score.Forty
typealias Deuce = Score.Deuce
typealias Advantage = Score.Advantage
typealias Game = Score.Game
```

As an example, the game starts with both players at love:

```Kotlin
val startScore : Score = Points(PointsData(Love,Love))
```

PlayerOne has forty points, and PlayerTwo has thirty points, you can create this value:

```Kotlin
val anotherScore : Score = Forty(FortyData(PlayerTwo,Thirty))

```

This model of the tennis score system enables you to express all legal values, while making illegal states unrepresentable.

```Kotlin
/* All exemple above don't work */
val impossibleScore1 : Score = Points(PointsData(Seven,Eleven))
val impossibleScore2 : Score = Points(PointsData(Forty,Forty))
val impossibleScore3 : Score = Forty(FortyData(PlayerTwo,Forty))
```

These types govern what can be stated in the domain, but they don't provide any rules for how values can transition from one state to another.
