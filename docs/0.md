## Meet Kotlin

### First tour

Open the [try site](https://try.kotlinlang.org/#/Examples/Hello,%20world!/Simplest%20version/Simplest%20version.kt) and try each code bellow, step by step

#### Binding

Variable declaration and assignement use `val` binding :

```Kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val greeting: String = "hello"
    val score: Int = 10
    println(greeting)
    println(score)
}
```

`val` bindings are immutables but you can declare mutable variables with `var`.

```Kotlin
var score: Int = 10
score = 5
println(score)
```

Be careful when you manipulate objects since a `val` reference is immutable, their properties aren't.

```Kotlin
val adHoc = object {
        var x: Int = 0
        var y: Int = 0
    }
adHoc.x = 2 //totaly ok
println(adHoc.x)
```

#### Types

The type system is completely "sound". This means that, as long as your code compiles fine, every type guarantees that it's not lying about itself. In Kotlin, the type system distinguishes between references that can hold null (nullable references) and those that can not (non-null references).

```Kotlin
var greeting: String = "Hello" //non Null String
greeting = null // compilation error : Null can not be a value of a non-null type String
var greeting2: String? = "Bye" // Nullable String
greeting2 = null // everything is ok
```

If you call a method or access a property Kotlin is guaranteed not to cause an NullPointerException

```Kotlin
var greeting: String = "Hello"
println(greeting.length) // print 5
var greeting2: String? = "Bye"
println(greeting2.length) // compilation error
```

You should perform safe calls when using nullable receivers.

```Kotlin
var greeting2: String? = "Bye"
println(greeting2?.length) // Safe call
greeting2 = null
// The compiler tracks the information about the check you performed, and allows the call to length inside the if
println(if (greeting2 != null) greeting2.length else -1)  // if is an expression !
// You can also use the Elvis Operator ?:
println(greeting2?.length ?: -1) // exactly the same as above
```

Kotlin types can be inferred. The type system deduces the types for you even if you don't manually write them down.

```Kotlin
val greeting = "hello"
val score = 10
```

Type aliases can refer to a type by a different name. They'll be equivalent:

```Kotlin
typealias ScoreType = Int
val score : ScoreType = 10
```

Type aliases are just synomyms usefull when you follow DDD principles. If you need to create a distinct type, you may create an inline class

```Kotlin
typealias ScoreType = Int
inline class ScoreInlineClass(val s: Int)

val score : Int = 10
val scoreT : ScoreType = 10
val scoreI : ScoreInlineClass = ScoreInlineClass(10)

fun acceptInt(s: Int){}
fun acceptScoreType(s: ScoreType){}
fun acceptScoreInlineClass(s: ScoreInlineClass){}

fun main() {
    acceptInt(scoreT) //OK Int and ScroreType are equivalent
    acceptScoreType(score) // Also OK
    acceptInt(ScoreInlineClass) // compilation error : can't pass inline class instead of underlying type
    acceptScoreInlineClass(score) // compilation error : can't pass underlying type instead of inline class
}
```

#### Collections

Kotlin provides some collections : Array, List, Set, Map

```Kotlin
// Represents an array (specifically, a Java array when targeting the JVM platform)
// Note: unlike Java, arrays in Kotlin are invariant. This means that Kotlin does not let us assign an Array<String> to // an Array<Any>, which prevents a possible runtime failure
val heroes : Array<String> = arrayOf("Carl", "Rick", "Michonne")

// New Array prepend by "Negan"
val moreHeroes = arrayOf("Negan", *heroes) // * is spread operator on Array

// Array are mutable
heroes[0]="Negan" // [] are short syntax for get and set
```

For other collecstion, Kotlin distinguishes between mutable and immutable collections

```Kotlin
val heroesList : List<String> = listOf("Carl", "Rick", "Michonne")
val firstL = heroesList[0]
heroesList[0]="Negan" //compilation error


val heroesMList : MutableList<String> = mutableListOf("Carl", "Rick", "Michonne")
val firstML = heroesMList[0]
heroesMList[0]="Negan" //ok
```

#### Product types

Kotlin provides `Pair` and `Triple` classes to represent tuples with 2 or 3 elements. In most cases, named property is a better design choice, Kotlin provides [data classes](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/data-classes.html) to design classes whose main purpose is to hold data.

```Kotlin

typealias Coord3d = Triple<Int,Int,Int>;

fun main() {
val nameAndHeart = Pair("Negan", 10)
val warehouseCoord = Coord3d(1, 4, 18)

data class Hero (val name: String, val heart: Int)
val negan = Hero("Negan", 10)
val (name, heart) = negan // pattern matching via destructuring

}
```

#### Sum types

[Sealed classes](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/sealed-classes.html) are used for representing restricted class hierarchies, when a value can have one of the types from a limited set, but cannot have any other type. So it's the way Kotlin use to provide variants.

```Kotlin
sealed class LifeVariant
data class Alive(val hero : Hero) : LifeVariant()
object Dead : LifeVariant()
object Zombie : LifeVariant()
```

Data class provides a class with the following functionality:

- getters (and setters in case of vars) for all properties
- equals()
- hashCode()
- toString()
- copy()
- component1(), component2(), …, for all properties

The key benefit of using sealed classes comes into play when you use them in a `when` expression to perform pattern matching.

```Kotlin
fun getMessage(howAreYou : LifeVariant) : String = when (howAreYou){
    is Dead -> "!!!"
    is Zombie -> "Aaaaaarg !"
    is Alive -> howAreYou.hero.name
}
```

Putting all piece together we can now define an ADT and perform a pattern mathing on it.

```Kotlin
data class Hero (val name: String, val heart: Int)

sealed class LifeVariant
data class Alive(val hero : Hero) : LifeVariant()
object Dead : LifeVariant()
object Zombie : LifeVariant()



fun getMessage(howAreYou : LifeVariant) : String = when (howAreYou){
    is Dead -> "!!!"
    is Zombie -> "Aaaaaarg !"
    is Alive -> howAreYou.hero.name
}

fun main() {
val negan = Hero("Negan", 10);
val howIsNegan = Alive(negan)
val howIsLori = Dead
println(getMessage(howIsNegan))
println(getMessage(howIsLori))
}
```

#### Options

Kotlin have [Null-safety](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html) mechanism. This is a great thing, as it wipes out an entire category of bugs. Obvioulsy we need sometime to represent the existence and nonexistence of a value. Last thing we want in this case is to fallback on unsafe code. While most languages provide an Option type for this purpose, Kotlin doesn't.

Fortunatly Option class is easy to implement through sealed class :

```Kotlin
sealed class Option<out T : Any>
data class Some<out T : Any> internal constructor(val value: T) : Option<T>()
object None : Option<Nothing>()
```

It means "a value of class Option is either None or that actual value wrapped in a Some".

Exemple :

```Kotlin
typealias Weapon = Option<String>

fun isDangerous(w : Weapon) : String = when (w) {
    is Some -> "Armed with a " + w.value
    is None -> "Not dangerous"
}

fun main() {
    val unArmed = None
    val knife = Some("knife")
    println(isDangerous(unArmed))
	println(isDangerous(knife))
}
```

#### Functions

Kotlin functions are first-class, which means that they can be stored in variables and data structures, passed as arguments to and returned from other higher-order functions.

Functions are declared with `fun` keyword. A lambda expression is always surrounded by curly braces, parameter declarations in the full syntactic form go inside curly braces and have optional type annotations.

```Kotlin
fun add(x : Int, y : Int) : Int {
    return x + y;
}
val addLamba : (Int, Int) -> Int  = { x, y -> x + y}
val addLambaInfer = { x : Int, y : Int -> x + y}
val addCurry : (Int) -> (Int) -> Int = { x -> {y -> x + y} }

val add1 = addCurry(1);

fun main() {
    println(add(1,2))
    println(addLamba(1,2))
    println(add1(2))
}
```

It's very common that a lambda expression has only one parameter.
If the compiler can figure the signature out itself, it is allowed not to declare the only parameter and omit `->`. The parameter will be implicitly declared under the name `it`:

```Kotlin
val myList = listOf(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
val positivelist1 = myList.filter({x -> x > 0})
val positivelist2 = myList.filter({it > 0})
```

There is much more amazing features to know in Kotlin, we just focus here in those that you should use to solve the tennis kata (￣^￣)ゞ
