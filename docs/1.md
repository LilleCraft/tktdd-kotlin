## Consideration about Points

#### Naive point attempt with a type alias

```Kotlin
typealias Point = Int
```

This easily enables you to model some of the legal point values:

```Kotlin
val p1 : Point = 15
val p2 : Point = 30
```

It looks good so far, but how do you model love? It's not really an integer. Still, both players start with love, so it's intuitive to try to model love as 0 ...It's a hack, but it works. But your illegal values are not unrepresentable :

```Kotlin
val p3 : Point  = 1000
val p4 : Point  = -20
```

For a 32-bit integer, this means that we have four legal representations (0, 15, 30, 40), and 4,294,967,291 illegal representations of a tennis point. Clearly this doesn't meet the goal of making illegal states unrepresentable. ლ(ಠ_ಠლ)

#### Second point attempt with a variant

You may see that love, 15, 30, and 40 aren't numbers, but rather labels. No arithmetic is performed on them. It's easy to constrain the domain of points with a variant

```Kotlin

sealed class Point{
    object Love : Point()
    object Fifteen : Point()
    object Thirty : Point()
    object Forty : Point()
}

typealias Love = Point.Love
typealias Fifteen = Point.Fifteen
typealias Thirty = Point.Thirty
typealias Forty = Point.Forty
```

A Point value isn't a score. A score is a representation of a state in the game, with a point to each player. You can model this with a record:

```Kotlin
data class PointsData (val playerOne: Point, val playerTwo: Point)
```

Exemple

```Kotlin
val s1 = PointsData(Love, Love)
val s2 = PointsData(Fifteen, Love)
val s3 = PointsData(Thirty, Love)
```
